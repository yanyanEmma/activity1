#3. Load the libraries  `tidyr` and `dplyr`
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
#4. Create a data frame from the `swirl-data.csv` file called `DF1`
DF1<-read.csv("~/Desktop/data mining/class-activity-1-master/swirl-data.csv")
DF1
#5. Create a new data frame that only includes the variables `hash`, `lesson_name` and #`attempt` called `DF2`
DF2<-select(DF1,hash,lesson_name,attempt)
DF2
#6. Use the `group_by` function to create a data frame that sums all the attempts for #each `hash` by each `lesson_name` called `DF3`
DF3<-DF2%>%group_by(hash,lesson_name)%>%summarise(s.attempt=sum(attempt))
DF3
#7. On a scrap piece of paper draw what you think `DF3` would look like if all the lesson names were column names
#8. Convert `DF3` to this format  
conDF3<-spread(DF3,lesson_name,s.attempt)
View(conDF3)
#9. Create a new data frame from `DF1` called `DF4` that only includes the variables `hash` and `correct`
DF4<-select(DF1,hash,correct)
#10. Convert the `correct` variable so that `TRUE` is coded as the **number** `1` and `FALSE` is coded as `0`  

to_num<-mutate(DF4,correct=as.numeric(as.logical(DF4$correct)))
to_num
#11. Create a new data frame that called `DF4` that provides a mean score for each student
nDF4<-bind_cols(hash=conDF3$hash,sum=rowMeans(conDF3[-1],na.rm = TRUE))
#12. **Extra credit** Convert the `datetime` variable into month-day-year format and create a new data frame (`DF5`) that shows the average correct for each day
yourtime=DF1$datetime
class(yourtime)=c('POSIXd','POSIXct')
yourtime=format(yourtime,format="%m-%d-%Y")
DF5<-bind_cols(correct=to_num$correct,time=yourtime)
DF5%>%group_by(time)%>%summarise(mean(correct,na.rm = TRUE))
